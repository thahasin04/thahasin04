## Housing Dataset Analysis

This repository contains the analysis of the housing dataset using scikit-learn. The primary goal is to replace GridSearchCV with RandomizedSearchCV in a single pipeline for data preparation and final prediction. Additionally, a transformer is added to select the most important attributes.

## Folder Structure

- `data/`: Contains the housing dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, modeling, and analysis.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Dataset Description

The housing dataset consists of features related to housing in Boston, aiming to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes. The dataset includes various attributes such as crime rate, pupil-teacher ratio, etc.

## Task Overview

### 1. Replacing GridSearchCV with RandomizedSearchCV

We've implemented RandomizedSearchCV in a single pipeline for data preparation and prediction. This process includes:

1. Loading and preprocessing the housing dataset.
2. Constructing a pipeline for data preparation and model prediction.
3. Using RandomizedSearchCV to tune hyperparameters efficiently.

2. Feature Selection Transformer
In this analysis, we've integrated a transformer into the pipeline to select the most important attributes for model training. This helps in improving model performance and reducing computational overhead.

Conclusion
The implementation of RandomizedSearchCV in the pipeline, along with the feature selection transformer, enhances the efficiency of model tuning and data preparation for predicting housing prices.

## Customer Churn Cluster Analysis
Overview
Customer churn refers to the percentage of customers who cease using a company's product or service within a specified time frame. This analysis focuses on understanding and mitigating customer churn for better business retention.

Importance of Customer Churn
Managing churn is crucial as it's more costly to acquire new customers than retain existing ones. By reducing churn, a company can enhance revenue and stability.

Methodology
1. Data Collection
Describe the source of the customer churn dataset.
Include details on the attributes/features present in the dataset.

3. Data Exploration
Explore the dataset to understand its structure, missing values, and statistical summaries.
Identify key variables that might influence churn (e.g., tenure, services subscribed, customer satisfaction).

5. Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features if necessary.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
 
7. Cluster Analysis
Utilize clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, hierarchical clustering) to segment customers based on behavior.
Determine the optimal number of clusters using methods like the elbow method or silhouette score.

9. Profiling Clusters
Describe each cluster's characteristics and behaviors.
Identify patterns or traits that differentiate one cluster from another.

11. Churn Prediction
Train a predictive model to forecast customer churn using classification algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forest).
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy..

13. Insights and Recommendations
Summarize findings and insights derived from the analysis.
Provide actionable recommendations to reduce churn based on cluster profiles and predictive model results.

How to Reduce Churn
Discuss strategies based on the analysis to mitigate customer churn.
Highlight actionable steps and potential areas for improvement.

Conclusion
Sum up the key takeaways and the significance of addressing customer churn.
Emphasize the importance of continuous monitoring and adaptation to retain customers effectively.
